                    <p>To create the most interesting display use a mixture of plants sizes and leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa
                        the peace lily, mixed with something sculptural like Susie the snake pland and a soft fern like
                        Bertie gives an attractive range of textures. Hanging plants like Rapunzel the golden
            pothos, add interest at different heights. Don#t forger yout pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while
        a mix of styles and pattern look electric and fun. </p>
